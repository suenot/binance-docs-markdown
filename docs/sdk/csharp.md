# C# (.NET) SDKs / Connectors for Binance API

For C# and other .NET developers, Binance provides an official lightweight connector.

## Official Binance Connector

This library offers direct access to Binance API endpoints.

*   **Spot API Connector (.NET):**
    *   GitHub: <https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-dotnet>
    *   Focus: Spot trading, Wallet, Margin, and other related endpoints available via `api.binance.com`.

*(Note: Check the connector's documentation for specific support for Futures or other APIs, or look for dedicated community libraries if needed.)*

**Note:** Similar to other official connectors, this library acts as a lightweight wrapper. Developers need to manage rate limiting, error handling, and other application logic.

## Community Libraries

*(This section can be expanded later if popular community libraries are identified)*

Various third-party C#/.NET libraries for Binance exist (e.g., `Binance.Net`). These often provide more features and higher-level abstractions. Evaluate them based on your project needs, community support, and maintenance status.

**Disclaimer:** When using third-party libraries, always review their security practices and ensure they are actively maintained.
