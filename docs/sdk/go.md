# Go SDKs / Connectors for Binance API

For Go developers, Binance provides an official lightweight connector to interact with its Spot API.

## Official Binance Connector

This library offers direct access to Binance API endpoints.

*   **Spot API Connector:**
    *   GitHub: <https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-go>
    *   Focus: Spot trading, Wallet, Margin, and other related endpoints available via `api.binance.com`.

*(Note: Check the connector's documentation for specific support for Futures or other APIs, or look for dedicated community libraries if needed.)*

**Note:** As with other official connectors, this library is generally a lightweight wrapper. Developers using it should expect to handle rate limiting, error checking, and other application-level logic.

## Community Libraries

*(This section can be expanded later if popular community libraries are identified)*

Third-party Go libraries for Binance might exist, potentially offering different features or levels of abstraction. Evaluate these based on your needs, community support, and maintenance status.

**Disclaimer:** When using third-party libraries, always review their security practices and ensure they are actively maintained.
