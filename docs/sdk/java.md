# Java SDKs / Connectors for Binance API

For Java developers, Binance provides official lightweight connectors to interact with its APIs.

## Official Binance Connectors

These libraries offer direct access to Binance API endpoints.

*   **Spot API Connector:**
    *   GitHub: <https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-java>
    *   Focus: Spot trading, Wallet, Margin, and other related endpoints available via `api.binance.com`.

*   **Futures API Connector:**
    *   GitHub: <https://github.com/binance/binance-futures-connector-java>
    *   Focus: USDâ“ˆ-M and COIN-M Futures trading endpoints available via `fapi.binance.com` and `dapi.binance.com`.

**Note:** Similar to the Python connectors, these are generally lightweight wrappers. Developers are typically responsible for handling rate limits, error checking, and higher-level logic.

## Community Libraries

*(This section can be expanded later if popular community libraries are identified)*

Third-party Java libraries might also exist, potentially offering different features or levels of abstraction. Evaluate any third-party library based on its features, community support, and maintenance status before integrating it into your project.

**Disclaimer:** When using third-party libraries, always review their security practices and ensure they are actively maintained.
