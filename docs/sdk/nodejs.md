# Node.js SDKs / Connectors for Binance API

For Node.js developers looking to integrate with Binance, an official lightweight connector is available.

## Official Binance Connector

This library offers direct access to Binance API endpoints for Spot, Wallet, Margin, etc.

*   **Spot API Connector:**
    *   GitHub: <https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-node>
    *   Focus: Primarily targets endpoints available via `api.binance.com`.

*(Note: Check the connector's documentation for specific support for Futures APIs, or look for dedicated community libraries if needed.)*

**Note:** Like other official connectors, this is generally a lightweight wrapper. Developers should be prepared to handle rate limiting, error checking, and application-specific logic.

## Community Libraries

*(This section can be expanded later if popular community libraries are identified)*

Various third-party Node.js libraries may exist for Binance, potentially offering different features or abstraction levels (e.g., `node-binance-api`). Evaluate these based on your needs, community support, and maintenance status.

**Disclaimer:** When using third-party libraries, always review their security practices and ensure they are actively maintained.
